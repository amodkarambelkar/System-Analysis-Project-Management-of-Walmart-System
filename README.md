# System-Analysis-Project-Management-of-Walmart-System

This is an on-going project where we have identified 3 use cases which Walmart can implement to maximize their profit. 

The implementation is shown in the document:

1. In the existing system, Walmart has a 90-day return policy and the returns processed 
are only tied to the Product ID which enables Walmart to identify whether an item was sold from their inventory. 
There is no system in place to tie it back to the customer. 
This results in people misusing their services and returning items often after using right till the 90-day mark. 
Return policies are for customer's satisfaction but any abuse in these policies should be tracked and an action 
should be taken against it.

2. Walmart currently offers free delivery on orders that exceed $35. 
Each order can be comprised of several items to meet the free delivery eligibility threshold.
A user can cancel an item once the order is placed and still avail free delivery. 
A customer should ideally be charged a shipping cost if the order value goes below $35.

3. Walmart stores are spread across a large area and it is difficult to locate a specific item inside the store. 
The existing feature of the Walmart app gives an information about the aisle number and shelf number of where a product is located.
But, a feature that can provide dynamic navigation to the exact product location on shelf would prove to be very handy 
for the customers.
